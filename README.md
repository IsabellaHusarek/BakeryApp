# BakeryApp
bakery app for the course Android Programming with Kotlin

Hi Dave,

this is my BakeryApp for the course Android Programming with Kotlin.

So I explain you what exactly the ideas of this app was in my Video... but here is a short description.

So I love baking and I wanted to have a place where I can store all my recipes...

At first there is a loading screen with a little progress bar i think that looks cool.
Then you can see the startpage so on the buttom there is a ButtomNavigation bar with 3 elements:
-Recipe list
-Info
-Shopping list

I also used Firebase to store all my Recipes.

So on the Recipe list you can add, delete, edit, filter new recipes.
you can enter a title for a recipe and rating stars and so on and then save it.
You can also add them to the Shopping list from there.
You can filter and search in the list.
You can also import recipe via an URL with all relevant data.

On the Shopping list you can add new Ingredients manuelly or import them from an saved recipe.
You can tick them if you buy them or delete them or delete the whole list.

I m happy how it comes out, even if it isnt as good as i wanted it to be because i have to do my bachelorsdegree until the 21.01 and i was a little stressed.
But I m looking forward to add the missing features in the future.

Yeah and sorry for my bad English I hope you can understand what i was trying to say. I also was very nervous while recording so yeah it sounds a little bumpy...
I also forgot to make this app in English and changed it later on, but i saw that i have missed to rename two things...
Github is also new for me so I hope you dont mind that i loaded up then i was almost ready. but i get used to it now.

So thanks for this nice course, I ve learned a lot!

Greetings,
Isabella
